	<p class="p4-80750-13"><span class="t4-80750-16">Britis 09~ April 19, 1882</span><span class="t4-80750-17"> </span></p>

	<p class="p4-80750-15"><span class="t4-80750-18">Charles Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, England. Although he entered Edinburgh University to study medicine, he discovered he wasn’t suited to be a doctor and dropped out after only two years. At his father’s urging, he entered Cambridge University and majored in theology. </span></p>
	<p class="p4-80750-15"><span class="t4-80750-18">But Darwin, who, from the time he was small, only had an interest in plants and animals. He was more eager to spend his time at Cambridge collecting insects and exploring nature than studying theology. The botanist Professor Henslow took notice of Darwin and recommended him as a naturalist to travel on the English Royal Navy survey ship, the Beagle. </span></p>
	<p class="p4-80750-15"><span class="t4-80750-18">Darwin thoroughly explored South America and numerous South Pacific islands and he discovered a clue to his theory of evolution on the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos Islands consists of 16 islands and a number of reefs. Darwin discovered that each island had a different environment and that the same species of animals that lived on different islands were of slightly different varieties. </span></p>
	<p class="p4-80750-15"><span class="t4-80750-18">After returning from the voyage in 1839, Darwin organized all the observational records he collected throughout his journey and published them as The Voyage of the Beagle. Darwin grew ill and moved into the Down House located in the outskirts of London, in Kent. There, Darwin organized materials related to his theory of evolution and began to write. </span></p>
	<p class="p4-80750-15"><span class="t4-80750-18">Then, in 1859, The Origin of Species was finally published. By 1860, the book had sparked controversy related to the theory of evolution. Scholars like Huxley and Hooker fervently supported Darwin’s position and disputed their views with their opponents. </span></p>
	<p class="p4-80750-15"><span class="t4-80750-18">  This resulted in The Origin of Species being published all around the world, with Darwin’s view gaining recognition. Darwin continued researching and writing into his 70s, but finally succumbed to illness in 1882, when he passed away at his home. Darwin’s theory of evolution was revolutionary, influencing the formation of mankind’s worldview.</span></p>
