	<p class="p12-1245-39">response to the theory of natural selection. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">The geologist Mivart originally supported my theory, </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">but he later became a fierce critic. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">Even though he could understand, for example, </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">the survival of organisms with fully developed eyes and wings, Mivart wondered how organisms </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">with less than fully developed eyes and wings </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">were able to survive.</p>

	<p class="p12-1245-39">if that organism mates with an organism without that trait, </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">then the trait will not be passed on to the offspring. </p>
