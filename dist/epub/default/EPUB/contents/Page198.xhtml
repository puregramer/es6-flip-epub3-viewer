	<p class="p198-50235-75">you discover some surprising things. </p>
	<p class="p198-50235-75">First, the fact that the environmental conditions of </p>
	<p class="p198-50235-75">two locations are the same does not necessarily mean </p>
	<p class="p198-50235-75">that organisms living in both places are the same. </p>
	<p class="p198-50235-75">On the other hand, organisms living </p>
	<p class="p198-50235-75">in completely different environments </p>
	<p class="p198-50235-75">can be very closely related.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="tbox-198-50257-1288"><p class="p12-1245-39">Second, when there are barriers to movement, </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">the organisms living in different areas will exhibit differences. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">Third, the organisms living on the same continent or </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">in the same part of the sea are closely related. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">Traveling from north to south, one can continuously </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">encounter organisms that are very closely related, </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">but belong to different species. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">Taking these facts into consideration, </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">one can infer a deep connection among organisms that is </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">unrelated to environmental conditions; heredity. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">In other words, heredity is the one thing that </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">can create similar organic beings.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="tbox-198-50279-1289"><p class="p12-1245-39">Climate change had a big influence on the movement of organisms. Even areas currently inhospitable to life may have been easily occupied by life in the past, under a different climate. </p>
	<p class="p12-1245-39">The elevation of land also likely had an influence on the movement of life. Furthermore, in the past, islands may have been connected to other islands, while continents may have also been linked together such that organisms could easily cross them.</p>
